# invisibilitycloak
This project recreates the Harry Potter invisibility cloak effect using Python and OpenCV. It detects a red cloak using HSV color filtering, masks the cloak area, and replaces it with a pre-captured background in real-time, creating an illusion of invisibility. The project demonstrates color detection, masking, and image blending techniques.
